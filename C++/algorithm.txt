//CS 240 - Assignment 3 - Roster Generator
//Created by: Nicholas Strange

Goals: 
		- Create a Player class.
		- Allow user to create and view a roster of instances of Player class.
		
Input:
		- First name, last name, and jersey number from the user
		- Menu selection (create Player, view roster, or exit) from the user
		
Output:
		- List of all Players created by user 
		
Requirements:
		- Player class must have first name, last name, and jersey number attributes.
		- Player roster must be stored in array on heap; dynamic memory allocation must be managed.
		- Maximum of 11 Players
		- Program should check for duplicated player names and jersey numbers.
		- User must be presented with a menu (create Player, view roster, or exit); program must collect user input and function accordingly.
		- Program must loop until either 11 Players have been entered or the user selects the exit option from the menu.
		- If 11 Players are created, program should immediately print out roster and terminate.
		- Class definition and implementation must be in separate files.
		
Step-by-step Details:
		1.) Create Player class
				- specify first name, last name, and jersey number attributes
				- define constructors, including one that sets attributes
				- define methods that print and return Player attributes
				
		2. Define Player array
		3. Loop the following until either 11 Players have been created or the user selects option to exit:
			4. Print menu options to console and collect user response
			5. If user chooses to create a Player, collect first name, last name, and player number from user.
			6. Construct Player using the user's input and store in Player array.
			7. If user chooses to view roster, use a loop to call the Player class's print method for each Player in array.
		8. Define condition to print entire roster if 11 Players were created.
		9. Use looping mechanism to check for duplicate player names and jersey numbers.
